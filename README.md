# Triangle Challenge

This helps the user determine triangle type based on the length of three sides.

  - Equilateral: All three sides match
  - Isosceles: Two of the three sides match
  - Scalene: No side matches
  - Invalid: The two smallest sides combined are less than the largest side

We have two solutions here. The first solution takes user inputs and returns the solution based on those inputs.

  - Go to your console, type "python app.py" and follow the input prompts.
  - Go ahead. Try to break this. I've considered almost every edge case

The second solution is a function that passes the sides in as arguments instead of user inputs. This one also comes with user tests.

  - Go to console, type "python app_alternate.py"
  - To test, type "python app_tests.py"
